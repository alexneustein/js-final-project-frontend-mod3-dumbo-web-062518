# Flatiron ChatterBox
created by [Andre Santiago](https://github.com/runandrerun) and [Daniel Chung](https://github.com/dlchung)

A chat app developed using a Ruby on Rails API, WebSockets, and pure Javascript. However, there is a twist. Can you understand what your friends are saying?

Currently, there is no user authentication/authorization or chat moderation. Test at your own discretion.
